    # dataset links are those that have a type that start with keyword "dataset"
    # and must have a name - but depending on the url, the name can be derived from the last part of the url

    # if the dataset is a csv type (has a "csv" in the type), we strongly recommend adding HXL Tags.
    # Please visit https://hxlstandard.org/ to learn how to add HXL tags to your datasets.

    # skip-hxl-tag-validation (optional) is a boolean flag that will skip hxl tag validation. the default value is false and is false if not present
    # the hxl-tag-validation is only applied to datasets with a `csv` type
    skip-hxl-tag-validation: true

    # name is optional for dataset links if it can be derived from the url
    # name: rollout_output_tl.geojson

    # alt-format (optional): if the dataset provides multiple formats (csv, geojson, shapefile) - they can be specified as alternate formats
    # multiple times, each alt-format providing a separate url and type
    # if the dataset is a csv type, hxl-tag validation is applied unless the skip-hxl-tag-validation flag is set to true

    # skip-hxl-tag-validation (optional) is a boolean flag that will skip hxl tag validation. the default value is false and is false if not present
    # the hxl-tag-validation is only applied to datasets with a `csv` type
# data-columns (optional) if your data is tabular format (eg. csv), you can supply the column names here
# if not provided, data-columns and sample-data will be extracted from the first csv or geojson dataset link provided
# in your links section.

# sample-data (optional) you can supply sample rows of your data
# if provided, you must also provide the data-columns entry which should
# match the values in each row in the order specified in the data-columns entry
